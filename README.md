## Introduction
This basic project is made for Polkadot Substrate development bootcamp with Rust which is held by <a href="https://risein.com">RiseIn</a>.

## Brief explanation
Aim of this software to practice about reference data types. Shortly, references in programming is a type that points to memory address of a variable. In the other hand, by help of address operators we can move to memory address (bare metal) via compiler.

In this project, I reach to two string slices via adress operator, converting them into a mutable variable, and concatenate them.
